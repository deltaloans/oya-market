# Oya Token Launch

[Oya](https://oya.market) is building a decentralized e-commerce protocol on Ethereum for buyers and sellers to deal directly and safely with each other, removing big monopoly middlemen and slashing fees. We’ve had a busy month since making it to the [finale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QavPuB57vs) of the [HackMoney hackathon](https://hackathon.money/) in June and today we’re excited to announce the mainnet launch of the [Oya token](https://etherscan.io/address/0x55ef32ecaf08a5f584bdd35be8901b89812ab922)!


## Oh no, why another token?

We get it. There have been a lot of dubious tokens launched over the years and we feel the token fatigue and skepticism as much as anyone. We want to be clear what the Oya token is for, what it’s not for, and what’s coming next.


## Community governance and engagement

We want our protocol to be owned and guided by its users from day zero. We’ve been hard at work on the [core e-commerce contracts](https://github.com/oya-protocol/oya-market/tree/master/contracts), but they’re months away from being ready for an audit and a mainnet launch. Token contracts are comparatively easy and allow us to have meaningful community engagement and governance before [the rest of the protocol](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiTo4vj58qk&t=3s) is live.

From the beginning, we’ve been [surveying e-commerce sellers](https://oya.market/landing) to learn what they want and need. We want to provide these sellers—really, our initial user base—with a tangible stake in the protocol and a reward for offering their insights. We also want them to be familiar with using crypto wallets and ready to participate in on-chain governance.

We also want to avoid the crypto exclusivity trap, where a small (and [not very diverse](https://www.coindesk.com/money-reimagined-cryptos-diversity-problem)) group of technical people own the vast majority of the wealth of an emerging protocol.

Now that we have a token contract that’s live on mainnet, we can issue tokens to our sellers and have them vote with their wallets on the direction we take in design and development. Initially, this will be through off-chain informal governance via [signature based voting](https://medium.com/@austin_48503/personal-token-voting-73b44a598d8e). When the rest of the protocol is live, our users should be familiar with the voting system and able to easily transition to trustless on-chain voting about proposed changes to the protocol.


## What about the token price?

Price considerations are secondary. We’re not using this token as a fundraising mechanism and token distribution is not aimed at pumping the price. The Oya token is a community governance mechanism and token distribution will be adjusted based on what encourages the most healthy community participation.

Decisions on token minting and distribution will be totally centralized in the early days as we grow our community of buyers and sellers and figure out as we go what makes the most sense. No one knows what the best distribution strategy is at this point. When the full protocol is live, token distribution will be totally decentralized and set by on-chain governance and the community will have learned a lot from the pre-launch period.

We’re aware that weird things can happen with Ethereum tokens, so we plan to plug into price discovery mechanisms like [Uniswap](https://uniswap.exchange) early on. The main purpose is not to provide liquidity to token holders, it’s to identify unexpected risks to the governance process that may be introduced by other smart contract systems like decentralized exchanges and lending protocols. We need to expose our token to these systems so that we can consider and mitigate these risks.

We expect a highly inflationary token supply as we grow our community, since the tokens exist to give users a vote and new users should not be disadvantaged compared to early users. (The crypto exclusivity trap, again.) However, the core development team expects to hold onto a significant chunk of voting power until we have a large and healthy community that is resistant to attack and capable of handling governance. Hopefully that won’t take very long.

The value of the protocol isn’t captured and stored in the tokens; it’s generated from each and every transaction between a buyer and seller. Our expectation is that buyers and sellers will earn tokens from transactions and that rapidly growing usage will mean rapid inflation of the token supply.

Supply inflation is a positive indicator that the protocol has more users, more sales, more open source contributions, lower fees, and more diverse and resilient governance. What that supply inflation does to the token’s price is only relevant to the extent it changes the risk profile of the governance system.


## Early team and seller rewards

Our initial hackathon team was Vanna Shutt, Yi Wu, and John Shutt. We’ve each received 999 tokens as an initial distribution so that we can test out minting and voting. We’ll also be issuing tokens to sellers who complete [our survey](https://oya.market/landing) and wallet onboarding and to new contributors who join the project. Token distributions will be pretty _ad hoc_ initially and should become more stable over time as we figure out as a community what makes sense.

(Note: Nine is the number associated with [Oya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E1%BB%8Cya), the orisha of winds and change and the namesake of our protocol. She is known as the “mother of nine.”)

By the time we have on-chain governance in place, we plan to have a large community ready to engage in truly decentralized governance, with the voting power of the early team steadily diminishing. It’s also important to note that we have no plans to sell tokens to investors. The tokens can only be earned by active contribution to and use of the Oya protocol.

Oya tokens can be bought and sold on decentralized exchanges but, as mentioned earlier, the price considerations are secondary and the tokens are first and foremost a governance mechanism, not an incentive mechanism. The way to get value from the Oya protocol is to save money on fees by using it for e-commerce transactions, not by hoarding tokens.


## Okay, but still, how can I get tokens?

If you run an e-commerce business, take our [seller survey](https://oya.market/landing) and complete our wallet onboarding process. We’re building this for you and want to put you in control! If you’re a designer, developer, bizdev, or product person, you can also earn tokens by contributing to the development of the protocol and its associated toolkit.


## What’s next for Oya?

We’re continuing seller outreach and training and would love to hear about your experiences in our [seller survey](https://oya.market/landing) if you have an e-commerce business, no matter what size. We’re offering free wallet training sessions for beginners and Dai rewards in addition to Oya token rewards to sellers who complete our onboarding. If you want to help fund seller rewards, you can contribute to our [Gitcoin grant](https://gitcoin.co/grants/773/oya-protocol)!

In addition to building the informal community governance system, we are working on decentralized product listings for the [HackFS](https://hackfs.com/) hackathon, where we were thrilled to meet and team up with expert e-commerce developer Josh Shupack.
